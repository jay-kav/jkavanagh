**Go** is a **web-based version of the classic strategy board game**, rebuilt to provide an engaging, responsive online experience.  
Developed with **Django (backend)** and **React (frontend)**, the project focuses on real-time game logic, smooth user interaction, and an intuitive interface that stays true to the original gameplay.
